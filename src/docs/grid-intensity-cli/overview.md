# Grid Intensity CLI - Overview

The electricity that powers the computers on which our code is run comes from a variety of sources - renewable, low-carbon, and fossil fuel based. We call this the fuel mix, and this fuel mix can impact on the carbon intensity of your code.

The Grid Intensity CLI aims to max information about the carbon intensity of regions around the world more accessible to developers. By doing so, they are better informed to make decisions about where and/or when to run their code.

## What is the Grid Intensity CLI?

A tool that enables developers and operations teams to surface, track, and understand the carbon intensity of running code.

## Why use it?

Because the fuel mix will be different depending when and where you run your code, you can influence the carbon intensity of the code you write by moving it through time and space.

### Moving through time

Sometime code _needs_ to be run in a particular region. In these instances, developers can use grid intensity information to identify periods of low carbon intensity on the grid - meaning that more green or renewable electricity is in the fuel mix. Scheduled jobs, or intensive computational tasks, can then be run during this time. 

### Moving through space

Increasingly, code is deployed to multiple regions around the world. In this scenario, developers can use the Grid Intensity CLI to easily consolidate carbon intensity data for different regions into a single dashboard or dataset.

With this information at hand, they can look for ways to run code in locations with a greener fuel mix. This can even be extended to setting up smarter, carbon aware routing so that more requests are directed towards code running in regions with a lower carbon intensity.

The above a just a few examples of the many and varied ways the Grid Intensity CLI can be used. If you’re using the Grid Intensity CLI in production we’d love to hear how! [Contact us](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/support-form/) via our website.
