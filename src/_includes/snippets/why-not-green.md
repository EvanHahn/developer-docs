### Why is a domain being returned as not green?

When a green hosting check is performed for a domain, we will return either `green: true` (it's a green host) or `green: false` (not a green host).

If you're expecting a green result, but not getting it, there are a few reasons why this might be happening. We've covered these in our FAQ - [_Why does my website show up as grey in the Green Web Checker?_](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/support/why-does-my-website-show-up-as-grey-in-the-green-web-checker/).
